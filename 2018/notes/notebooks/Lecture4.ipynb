    "- The lambda function is a way to create anonymous throw-away functions.\n",
    "- A file that contains Python definitions (names, functions, etc.) is a module. A module can be imported into other modules or into the main module.\n",
    "- A package is a way of structuring Python’s module namespace by using “dotted module names”.\n",
    "- When a Python program encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception.\n",
    "- A try statement may have more than one except clause to specify handlers for different exceptions. But at most one handler will be executed.\n",
    "- When a Python function raises an exception, it must either handle the exception or another handler up the call stack will have to handle it.\n",
    "- Everything in Python is an object (i.e. an instance of some class). Even types, functions, and exceptions are objects. Today, we will see that classes themselves are objects! Their type is `type`."

The object's \\_\\_enter\\_\\_( ) is called before with-block is executed and therefore can run set-up code. It also may return a value that is bound to the name variable, if given. After the execution of the with-block is finished, the object's \\_\\_exit\\_\\_( ) method is called, even if the block raised an exception, and can therefore run clean-up code.\n",
